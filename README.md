## Procedures
    
    string activity_file_name()

Returns the name of the data file in which activity data for the current clan is stored.

    cl_player[int] clan_members(int clanid)
    
Returns a map of the members of the clan with the given clan ID, indexed by 0, 1, 2, ...
    
    void get_clan_activity(string[string][int][string][string][int] activity,
                           int[int][string][item] stash_activity)

Reads data from the clan activity data files into the two given maps (see `activity_file_name()` and `stash_activity_file_name()`), adds data to the maps from the Clan Activity Log of the current clan, and writes the updated data into the clan activity data files.  The data are left in the maps for use after `get_clan_activity()` completes.

The keys to the activity map are, in order:

* `string` denoting the type of activity: `"basement"` for basement activity, `"inout"` for entering and leaving the clan, `"lounge"` for VIP lounge activity, and `"misc"` for miscellaneous activity.
* `int` denoting the time of the activity, expressed as a human-readable timestamp.  For example, `202105011645` is May 1, 2021, at 4:45 PM
* `string` giving the name of the player-character that did something
* `string` code for what the player-character did: 
  * `"basement"` activity has `"closed"` for closing a dungeon, `"meat"` for recovering meat from a dungeon, and `"opened"` for opening a dungeon
  * `"inout"` activity has `"admitted"` for admitting a new member, `"otherclan"` for joining another clan, and`"rejoined"` for rejoining the current clan
  * `"lounge"` activity has `"fabricated"` for fabricating something in the Floundry
  * `"misc"` activity has `"applied"` for applying for clan membership, `"chgrank"` for changing a clan member's rank, `"chgtitle"` for changing a clan member's title, `"modrank"` for modifying a clan rank, `"posted"` for posting an announcement, and `"xfrlead"` for transferring leadership
* `int` is a serial number 

And the value of the map is a string denoting the object of the activity, or `-` if there is no object.

Note: Activity by CheeseFax and Easyfax are not included.

The keys to the stash activity map are, in order:

* `int` denoting the time of the activity, expressed as a human-readable timestamp.  For example, `202105011645` is May 1, 2021, at 4:45 PM
* `string` giving the name of the player-character that moved things into or out of the stash
* `item` denoting what item was moved.  If `$item[none]`, then the player contributed meat. 

And the value of the map is a number denoting how many of the item was moved, or how much meat was contributed.  If positive, items were added to the stash; if negative, items were taken from the stash.

    cl_clannie[int] get_clannies()

Returns a map of all the members of the current clan, indexed by the characters' ID numbers.
    
    boolean is_active(cl_player p)

Returns `true` if and only if the given player-character has logged in within the last 40 days.
    
    boolean join_clan(string name)

Join the clan (to which you should be whitelisted) with the given name (case-insensitive).  Returns `false` if the attempt to join failed.

    dungeon_run[int] load_raidlogs() 
    
Similar to the previous procedure, but returns the raid logs in a new map.
    
    cl_name_id lookup_clan_id(string name)

Returns a clan name/clan ID number pair for the clan with the given name (case-insensitive).
    
    string[string] players_loot(dungeon_run[int] raidlogs, string player)
    
Given a map of basement raid logs and the name of a player-character, returns a map of the loot received by the character.  The keys of the map are strings of the form `"yyyy-MM-dd n"`, where `yyyy-MM-dd` is a date like `2021-05-01` and `n` is a serial number, in case the character receives multiple pieces of loot in the same day.
